# Diagrams

## workflow_bosh_pks.html

### Overview

This workflow tries to give a high level overview of what happens when you deploy a BOSH director, upload some BOSH releases, and deploy the PKS API. Then it shows how the PKS API talks back to BOSH to deploy K8s clusters and interacts with NSX-T. The diagram shows the BOSH components but at the very end shows how they are bundled in to OpsMan.

### Usage

1. Download the `workflow_bosh_pks.html` file.
1. Open `workflow_bosh_pks.html` in a browser window.
1. Use the `left`/`right` arrows keys to move through the steps.


## Todo
